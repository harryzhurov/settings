0. sudo apt-get install autofs smbclient cifs-utils

1. Add in /etc/auto.master the following line:

/mnt/smb /etc/auto.smb

2. Replace /etc/auto.smb with file in this repo (use symbolic link)

This allows full access for anonymous guests

3. For authorized access create:

/etc/creds

Directory and place there credentials. The credendials is a file containing 
just two lines:

username=name
password=******

The name of credentials file should be the name of share, for example if 
the share host is 192.168.0.18 the credentials file name:

/etc/creds/192.168.0.18

Lock credentials from view/edit access:

sudo chmod 600 <cred-file-name>


P.S. To restart autofs daemon:

sudo service autofs restart

There is a problem with DNS: local service (dnsmasq) does not always work 
properly, local dns (dnsmasq) should be turn off. There are two ways:

1. (Recommeded). Turn off dnsmasq in NetworkManager service:

sudo mcedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and comment out line 
with 'dns' setting:

#dns=dnsmasq

2. Add manually external DNS server to /etc/resolf.conf:

run dns-oesd to add DNS of OESD network to /etc/resolv.conf
